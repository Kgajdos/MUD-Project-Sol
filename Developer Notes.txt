*********************************************PROJECT OVERVIEW*********************************************
The project has made significant progress with the addition of multiple prototypes. Currently, the primary focus is on stabilizing the core functionalities and addressing known bugs. Several new features and improvements are planned to enhance gameplay, including wearable item enhancements, quality attributes for objects, and improved inventory management. Tutorials for various player roles are being developed to guide new players. Upcoming features include corporate roles and an exploration system.

*********************************************KNOWN BUGS*********************************************
1. **Renaming a Ship**
   - **Issue**: Renaming a ship breaks its connection to the room, causing it to no longer appear under "You see: _____".
   - **Action**: Investigate and resolve the disconnection issue, ensuring the ship's reference updates correctly within the room's context.
   - **Priority**: High
   - **Status**: Fixed - Temp, need to make sure player.db.active_ship is set 

2. **Character Stats**
   - **Issue**: Significant difficulties with character stats, possibly related to improper usage of enums.
   - **Action**: Review the character stats system, check enum implementation, and refactor as needed to ensure proper functionality.
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Status**: In-Progress

3. **CmdPutAway Command**
   - **Issue**: The CmdPutAway command is outdated and non-functional.
   - **Action**: Update the CmdPutAway command to reflect current game mechanics and inventory handling.
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Status**: To-Do

4. **CombatHandler Script**
   - **Issue**: The CombatHandler script endlessly repeats the ending message.
   - **Action**: Debug and fix the loop to ensure the ending message only triggers once.
   - **Priority**: High
   - **Status**: To-Do

   - **Issue**: Multiple prototypes are not properly implemented and will result in an error when trying to spawn.
   - **Action**: Systematically debug all prototypes until they can properly be spawned in.
   - **Priority**: High
   - **Status**: To-Do

   - **Issue**: Multiple look commands when in the same room as a ship.
   - **Action**: Add a lock to the ship's look command to ensure it's only called when the ship is puppeted and by the puppeteer.
   - **Priority**: Low
   - **Status**: Fixed

   - **Issue**: Anyone can board and fly anyone's ship.
   - **Action**: Add locks and possibly hacking features to allow some level of safety for players. For simplicity, start by locking the boarding and console commands behind self.db.pilot == caller.
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Status**: In-Progress

   - **Issue**: Command console creates this error: 
     ```plaintext
     console
     Traceback (most recent call last):

### Developer Notes - [6 AUG 2024]

**Past Updates and Fixes:**

1. **Menu Node Error Fix:**
   - Fixed the error with `menunode_set_destination` by ensuring it properly queries available destinations and uses `get_all_space_room_identifiers()`.

2. **New Room Creation Logic:**
   - Implemented `create_new_room()` to handle the creation of new rooms with random descriptions and types.
   - Added functionality to randomly pick a room type and ensure the room description matches the type.
   - Ensured newly created rooms have keys that match their descriptions and include default descriptions for various room types.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Addressed issues with room type checking and corrected the handling of `no_default` parameter.
   - Fixed errors related to setting room attributes and handling database-related exceptions.

4. **Testing and Verification:**
   - Verified the functionality by running tests to ensure new rooms are created correctly and menu nodes transition as expected.

**12 March 2025:**
1. **Tested Console:**
   - Tested fly into uncharted space
	- Testing reveals the room is created but cannot be found
		- Likely a bug in how the function fetches the list of rooms
   - Tested set destination
	- Testing reveals that function is not implemented
2. **Updates on First Steps Mission**
   - Ongoing issues with calling the required mission start function
   - No safeguards are implemented to include:
	- Saving
	- Checkpoints
	- Player logging off could disrupt mission
3. **Verified Bugs:**
   - Console cannot be accessed until the server is restarted. 
	- Find ways to update the ship without restarting the server
   - Board currently lets the player puppet any player/character in the room
	- Filter results to only allow the player's ship to be boarded
		- Need to account for multiple ships owned by other players to be in the same room/hanger 
**16 March 2025:**
1. **Fixed tutorial mission not working with a new character**
	- Works as intended
2. **Attempted to fix ship name change from breaking**
	- Bug where the ship.db.shipID is None before the server resets
