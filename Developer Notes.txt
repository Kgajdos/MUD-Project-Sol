*********************************************PROJECT OVERVIEW*********************************************
The project has made significant progress with the addition of multiple prototypes. Currently, the primary focus is on stabilizing the core functionalities and addressing known bugs. Several new features and improvements are planned to enhance gameplay, including wearable item enhancements, quality attributes for objects, and improved inventory management. Tutorials for various player roles are being developed to guide new players. Upcoming features include corporate roles and an exploration system.

*********************************************KNOWN BUGS*********************************************
1. **Renaming a Ship**
   - **Issue**: Renaming a ship breaks its connection to the room, causing it to no longer appear under "You see: _____".
   - **Action**: Investigate and resolve the disconnection issue, ensuring the ship's reference updates correctly within the room's context.
   - **Priority**: High
   - **Status**: Fixed - Temp, need to make sure player.db.active_ship is set 

2. **Character Stats**
   - **Issue**: Significant difficulties with character stats, possibly related to improper usage of enums.
   - **Action**: Review the character stats system, check enum implementation, and refactor as needed to ensure proper functionality.
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Status**: In-Progress

3. **CmdPutAway Command**
   - **Issue**: The CmdPutAway command is outdated and non-functional.
   - **Action**: Update the CmdPutAway command to reflect current game mechanics and inventory handling.
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Status**: To-Do

4. **CombatHandler Script**
   - **Issue**: The CombatHandler script endlessly repeats the ending message.
   - **Action**: Debug and fix the loop to ensure the ending message only triggers once.
   - **Priority**: High
   - **Status**: To-Do

   - **Issue**: Multiple prototypes are not properly implemented and will result in an error when trying to spawn.
   - **Action**: Systematically debug all prototypes until they can properly be spawned in.
   - **Priority**: High
   - **Status**: To-Do

   - **Issue**: Multiple look commands when in the same room as a ship.
   - **Action**: Add a lock to the ship's look command to ensure it's only called when the ship is puppeted and by the puppeteer.
   - **Priority**: Low
   - **Status**: Fixed

   - **Issue**: Anyone can board and fly anyone's ship.
   - **Action**: Add locks and possibly hacking features to allow some level of safety for players. For simplicity, start by locking the boarding and console commands behind self.db.pilot == caller.
   - **Priority**: Medium
   - **Status**: In-Progress

   - **Issue**: Command console creates this error: 
     ```plaintext
     console
