Known Bugs
-----------
Ship Issues
- Renaming a ship breaks its connection to the room
  - Ship will no longer show up under "You see: _____"

Character Stats
- Immense difficulties with character stats
  - Unsure if enums are being utilized

Command Issues
- Command Update Needed: CmdPutAway
  class CmdPutAway(Command):
      """
      Puts an item into the bag

      Usage:
          store <item_name> in <storage container>
      """
      key = "store"

      def parse(self):
          self.args = self.args.strip()
          item, *container = self.args.split(" in ", 1)
          self.item = item.strip()
          if container: #sets the container if there is one specified
              self.container = container[0].strip()
          else:
              self.container = "" #defaults to no container

      def func(self):
          items = self.caller.search(self.item)
          if items:
              item = items
          else:
              self.caller.msg(f"You do not have {items} in your hand.")
              return

          item = self.caller.search(items)
          self.obj.add(item)

Script Issues
- CombatHandler Script: Endlessly repeats the ending message

-----------------
Books
- Create book objects with menus and contents
  - Every page is an object with a number and text stored in the book
  - Directory for books, each with its own defining file

Wearables

  - Document how to build the object in-game
  - Example:
  class ToolQuality(Enum):
      POOR = 0.01
      LOW = 0.05
      MED = 0.10
      GOOD = 0.15
      GREAT = 0.20
      EXTRAORDINARY = 0.25
