KNOWN BUGS:
*Renaming a ship breaks it's connection to the room - not sure why
	**Ship will no longer show up under You see: _____
*Immense difficulties with character stats
	-Unsure if enums are being utilized
*This command no longer works, needs to be updated:
class CmdPutAway(Command):
    """
    Puts an item into the bag

    Usage:
        store <item_name> in <storage container>
    """
    key = "store"

    def parse(self):
        self.args = self.args.strip()
        item, *container = self.args.split(" in ", 1)
        self.item = item.strip()
        if container: #sets the container if there is one specified
            self.container = container[0].strip()
        else:
            self.container = "" #defaults to no container

    def func(self):
        items = self.caller.search(self.item)
        if items:
            item = items
        else:
            self.caller.msg(f"You do not have {items} in your hand.")
            return

        item = self.caller.search(items)
        self.obj.add(item)

*CombatHandler Script will endlessly repeat ending message
*Mine command does not work

Create book objects that have menu's and contents, every page is object with a number and text and is stored in book:
BOOK(menu) ----> PAGE(text, pg#)

Books now have their own directory within the game as each book will have it's own file to define it
	*is it the right answer? Probably not
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Give wearables "stats" and make sure to document how to build the object in game - In progress
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
start considering how objects improve players life (this will be a long road). 
Started:
class ToolQuality(Enum):
    POOR = 0.01
    LOW = 0.05
    MED = 0.10
    GOOD = 0.15
    GREAT = 0.20
    EXTRORDINARY = 0.25
These act as percentages.

Start seperating player roles/jobs based on their chosen class.
All pilots will need a tutorial on basic movement, commands, and ship commands.
*Miner: Tutorial on finding asteroids, landing or attaching (what the difference is), and beginning mining
	**If they find an asteroid large enough to land on, have a tutorial on space mining where the player leaves the comfort of the
ship and mines the asteroid alongside their ship. This only works on massive asteroids that are at least ten times the size of the ship.
*Fighter: Tutorial on getting contracts, fulfilling them, and general space travel
	**Focus more on close combat space flight 
*Freighter: Tutorial on getting contracts, fulling storage space, understanding economies, and deep-space travel.
	**Encourage players to pick up a "Hobby" to pass the time
*Researcher: Tutorial on their ship's unique research room and all it's fixin's. Provide beginner contracts to allow the player
to build up their relevant skills.
