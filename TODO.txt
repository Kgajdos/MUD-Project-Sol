KNOWN BUGS:
Store command currently sends item to all available storage units. Not good
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create book objects that have menu's and contents, every page is object with a number and text and is stored in book:
BOOK(menu) ----> PAGE(text, pg#)

Books now have their own directory within the game as each book will have it's own file to define it
	*is it the right answer? Probably not
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Create wearables object with applicable commands (In progress, few bugs)
bugs include:
	*Not checking if player is already wearing something (only change would be some text flair that 
tells the player they're removing one piece of armor for another
	*Remove exists in infancy
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
start considering how objects improve players life (this will be a long road). 
QUALITY LEVEL = -POOR: +1
		-MODEST: +2
		-GOOD: +3
		-GREAT: +4
		-SPECTACULAR: +5
Example:
	*MultiTool provides a +5 to every skill check it's used with. Can be used with fabricating, tinkering, guns (Maintainence), melee (same), and maintainence
	*Weapons provide based off of quality and type:
		**Riffle +5 + (quality level)
		**Pistol +3 + (quality level)
		**Infernal Knife + 3 + (quality level)
			-Inflicts +1 burn damage every second for a max of 10 seconds + melee level

Start seperating player roles/jobs based on their chosen class.
All pilots will need a tutorial on basic movement, commands, and ship commands.
*Miner: Tutorial on finding asteroids, landing or attaching (what the difference is), and beginning mining
	**If they find an asteroid large enough to land on, have a tutorial on space mining where the player leaves the comfort of the
ship and mines the asteroid alongside their ship. This only works on massive asteroids that are at least ten times the size of the ship.
*Fighter: Tutorial on getting contracts, fulfilling them, and general space travel
	**Focus more on close combat space flight 
*Freighter: Tutorial on getting contracts, fulling storage space, understanding economies, and deep-space travel.
	**Encourage players to pick up a "Hobby" to pass the time
*Researcher: Tutorial on their ship's unique research room and all it's fixin's. Provide beginner contracts to allow the player
to build up their relevant skills.
