"""
An example EvMenu for the character creator contrib.

This menu is not intended to be a full character creator, but to demonstrate
several different useful node types for your own creator. Any of the different
techniques demonstrated here can be combined into a single decision point.

## Informational Pages

A set of nodes that let you page through information on different choices.

The example shows how to have a single informational page for each option, but
you can expand that into sub-categories by setting the values to dictionaries
instead of simple strings and referencing the "Option Categories" nodes.

## Option Categories

A pair of nodes which let you divide your options into separate categories.
The base node has a list of categories as the options, which is passed to the
child node. That child node then presents the options for that category and
allows the player to choose one.

## Multiple Choice

Allows players to select and deselect options from the list in order to choose
more than one. The example has a requirement of choosing exactly 3 options,
but you can change it to a maximum or minimum number of required options -
or remove the requirement check entirely.

## Simple List Options

If you just want a straightforward list of options, without any of the back-and-forth
navigation or modifying of option text, evennia has an  easy to use decorator
available: `@list_node`

For an example of how to use it, check out the documentation for evennia.utils.evmenu
- there's lots of other useful EvMenu tools too!

## Starting Objects

Allows players to choose from a selection of starting objects.

When creating starting objects e.g. gear, it's best to actually create them
at the end, so you don't have to patch checks in for orphaned objects or
infinite-object player exploits.

## Choosing a Name

The contrib character create command assumes the player will choose their name
during character creation. This section validates name choices before confirming
them.

## The End

It might not seem like an important part, since the players don't make a decision
here, but the final node of character creation is where you finalize all of
the decisions players made earlier. Initializing skills, creating starting gear,
and other one-time method calls and set-up should be put here.
