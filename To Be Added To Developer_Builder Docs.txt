SPACE HAZARDS: 
Micro-Meteoroids and Space Debris:

Small, high-speed particles and debris left over from asteroid collisions, satellite fragments, or spacecraft components.
Hazards include punctures or damage to ship hulls, potential impact damage to sensitive equipment or crew, and increased risk of collisions during navigation.
Solar Radiation and Flares:

Intense radiation emitted by stars, particularly during solar flares or coronal mass ejections (CMEs).
Exposure to high levels of solar radiation can damage ship electronics, disrupt communications systems, and pose health risks to crew members if not adequately shielded.
Gravitational Anomalies:

Variations in gravitational fields caused by celestial bodies, such as planets, moons, or black holes.
Hazards include gravitational tidal forces that can disrupt ship trajectories, gravitational lensing that distorts sensor readings, and potential gravitational slingshots that alter course trajectories unexpectedly.
Ionizing Radiation from Cosmic Rays:

High-energy particles originating from outside the solar system, such as cosmic rays.
Exposure to cosmic radiation can pose long-term health risks to crew members and degrade sensitive electronics over time if not adequately shielded.
Electromagnetic Interference (EMI):

Interference caused by electromagnetic radiation emitted by nearby electronic devices, power sources, or natural phenomena.
EMI can disrupt ship communications, navigation systems, and sensor readings, leading to navigation errors, loss of situational awareness, and increased vulnerability to hostile threats.
Space Weather Events:

Geomagnetic storms and other space weather phenomena caused by interactions between solar wind and planetary magnetic fields.
Hazards include magnetic disturbances that affect ship compasses and navigation systems, increased atmospheric drag that alters orbital trajectories, and auroral displays that interfere with sensor readings.
Fuel and Resource Limitations:

Finite supplies of fuel, life support resources, and consumables required for long-duration space travel.
Hazards include fuel leaks or depletion, oxygen and water shortages, and limited availability of spare parts or repair materials, requiring careful resource management and planning to avoid critical failures.
Communication Blackouts:

Periods of interrupted or degraded communication links between spacecraft and ground control stations.
Hazards include loss of real-time telemetry data, inability to receive navigation updates or emergency assistance, and increased reliance on onboard systems for autonomous decision-making.
